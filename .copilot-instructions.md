# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Budget App

This project uses a budget-centric architecture. Always refer to `.github/copilot/copilot-context.md` for complete system documentation.

## Key Rules:
1. All entities belong to a budget (budget-centric design)
2. Always validate user permissions before operations
3. Use TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
4. Follow responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS
5. Implement proper error handling in all routes

## Primary Context File:
- `.github/copilot/copilot-context.md` - Complete system architecture and business rules

## Templates Available:
Use VS Code snippets: `budget-route`, `budget-component`, `budget-model`, `budget-service`
